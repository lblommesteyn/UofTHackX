# EmpowermentExplorer
 
This project is a tool that uses web scraping, the Cohere API, and sentiment analysis to generate an EDI (Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion) dedication score for a given company.

Our EDI Calculator is a powerful tool for individuals and organizations looking to make informed decisions about the companies they support. It helps users to easily identify companies that are truly dedicated to promoting equity, diversity, and inclusion in the workplace.

Thank you for checking out our project, and we hope you find it useful!
